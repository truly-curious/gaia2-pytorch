## üìñ Introduction

The Gaia2-PyTorch project focuses on developing a world model architecture that allows self-driving cars to learn from their environment. By utilizing deep learning techniques, we aim to create a model that can understand complex driving scenarios and make informed decisions. This repository provides the necessary tools and resources for researchers and developers interested in advancing the field of autonomous driving.

## üåü Features

- **Modular Design**: The architecture is designed to be modular, allowing users to easily customize components for their specific needs.
- **High Performance**: Built on PyTorch, the implementation leverages GPU acceleration for faster training and inference.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation helps users understand the architecture and its components.
- **Community Support**: Join our community to share ideas, report issues, and contribute to the project.

## üì¶ Installation

To get started with Gaia2-PyTorch, follow these steps to install the necessary dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/truly-curious/gaia2-pytorch.git
   cd gaia2-pytorch
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. For pre-trained models and additional resources, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/truly-curious/gaia2-pytorch/releases).

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

After installation, you can start using the Gaia2-PyTorch framework. Here‚Äôs a simple example to get you started:

```python
import torch
from gaia2 import WorldModel

# Initialize the world model
model = WorldModel()

# Load a pre-trained model (if available)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('path/to/pretrained/model.pth'))

# Run inference
output = model.predict(input_data)
```

For more detailed examples and use cases, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

The world model architecture consists of several key components:

1. **Perception Module**: This module processes sensor data (e.g., images, LIDAR) to extract meaningful features.
2. **World Model**: The core of the architecture, this component simulates the environment and predicts future states.
3. **Controller**: Based on the predictions from the world model, the controller makes decisions about the vehicle's actions.

## üìä Training

To train the model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset according to the required format.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path path/to/dataset --epochs 100
   ```

3. Monitor training progress through logs and visualizations.

For more advanced training options, check the `train.py` script and the associated documentation.

## üîç Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of your trained model, use the evaluation script provided in the repository:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/trained/model.pth --test_data path/to/test_data
```

This script will output various metrics to help you understand the model's performance.
